These have been in english so far however there's plenty of opportunity and appetite to have these in other languages too.\n\nWith NotebookLM and <https://www.heygen.com/|HeyGen> (free version) we've been able to get some translations done of the slides (NotebookLM) and translation voiceover of the script along with an avatar (HeyGen). We're getting a ramp card approved for a paid version so that we can go beyond 3 minutes of video and potentially have our own custom avatar and voice.\n\nThis will be great in the new year to share out our webinar content to more markets.\n\nOriginal english presentation: <https://shopify-2.wistia.com/medias/g1uqmtjp4i>\nAI based Spanish translation (voice was sped up to get more in the 3 minute video and only content slides were selected for this test ): <https://drive.google.com/file/d/12xsmUP_-68_11N-Dg4QgcF-7UK2r7TfU/view?usp=sharing>\n\nIf you're working on marketing videos, this could be a great tool as well.",

So at the end of 2024, <@U02CGBXJQRJ> sold them three Commerce Catalysts (one for each day) as a comprehensive three-day in-person training and tailored workshop (in Thai language) to facilitate knowledge transfer and total USD $9k billing. :money_with_wings:\n\nIn most South East Asian :earth_asia: cultures, it isn't quite common for training participants to raise their hands and ask questions with the fear of perception.\n\nSo as Kriang and I were prepping for the Commerce Catalyst delivery (22-24 Jan 2025) with the goal to move the needle on attendees hands-on capability navigating Shopify and be able to carry out their BAUs, we wanted to give them an avenue for them to ask their questions in an anonymous way. :incognito:\n\nKnowing also that I was one of the 3 non-Thai speakers who would be in the training attended by &gt;60 people, I wanted to have the Questions Parking Lot something they could input their questions to in Thai, but also something that I can answer in English (and then translated to Thai).\n\nSo I built <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kkWe7R7Jp9LSjuePdXuamwPXRrHpcbz1xWaBCCB3VLc/edit?gid=0#gid=0|this spreadsheet>:sheets: that auto-translates Thai :thailandflag: -&gt; English :gb: and English :gb: -&gt; Thai :thailandflag: with the help of Apps Script :apps-script: and our <https://openai-proxy.shopify.io/|OpenAI Proxy>. :openai:\n\nIt received 5 questions in Thai  but that then opened them up to asking a total of 40 questions in the sheet over the course of the 3 days and many more follow up questions offline. :win:\n\nHappy to answer questions for folks interested especially as we push to more international non-English markets. :slightly_smiling_face:",

      "description": "Perhaps a slightly more mundane use of AI, but one that has saved me so much - _so much_ - time that it might be useful for others as well.\n\nI'm currently working on <https://vault.shopify.io/gsd/projects/44162-Bridging-Revenue-and-Privacy|a project> to bring the Revenue and Privacy orgs closer together, so that we in Revenue always have the necessary context to know where these concerns are coming from, can respond to them better and faster. I reckon if we find the whole topic (let's be honest) less daunting, then so will our merchants!\n\nThe context I'm working on will eventually live in Seismic, but at the moment I have enlisted three AIs (Perplexity, which I love so very much, ShopifyGPT, and VaultBot) to <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xdFEbLYL1awtAZYjwcSiqa8qKgrOt1neGL01WFJvRrA/edit?pli=1&amp;gid=0#gid=0|scope it out>.\n\n• Perplexity has given me ten privacy challenges merchants are facing in e-commerce (column A) along with a description of each (column B). After checking that these match what we see, I've then fine-tuned the prompt to provide me with how each challenge plays out in the Sales context (column F), the Launch context (column G), and the Merchant Success context (column L). Naturally, Perplexity isn't tuned into how we operationalize these internally, so some human adjustment is needed (column H). This took about 2 hours for the prompting and arranging, and 1 hour for the human corrections.\n• I then fed columns A and B into VaultBot and asked it to give me a project, team, or resource that lives in the Vault, along with an explanation to how it relates to the challenge. These are in columns M and N and I haven't had a chance to look over them yet so may or may not be accurate. But it's a great start and took me less than 10 minutes.\n• Next, I fed the challenges into ShopifyGPT (the one that has some internal context but doesn't do PII) and asked it to provide me with five sample merchant questions for each (column I) so that the context comes to life. This also took less than 10 minutes.\n• And finally, I fed those sample questions back into Perplexity to give me sample answers so I know what merchants might find if they just do a random search about this. This allows us to eventually phrase sample responses that reflect not only merchant concerns, but also (mis)information they may find online about them. This took just a few minutes for Perplexity.\nOf course, the end result will be subject to reviews from our esteemed Privacy folks and various others in our Orgs, but as it stands, without AI, this would have taken me days, if not weeks to scope.",

I've been able to put together projects in an hour that would have taken me months to figure out.\n\nIt isn't perfect, it does get things wrong, and that is where my (very) basic understanding of programming has been useful. Outside of the occasional error, though, it has been able to build entire mini-apps and dynamic web pages from scratch - I even use it for SQL and now documentation! All of which I can easily backup in my team's Github repo (which is otherwise primarily used for project management).\n\nHere's an example: I had an idea for a hardware troubleshooting flow. After deciding to put together a mockup, I was bemoaning Figma license costs and access. That's when I had a lightbulb moment. I pulled several example websites as samples, explained to Cursor what I wanted to do (in detail), and voilà - a functioning mockup was created!\n\nAdmittedly, I did have to go through a bit of troubleshooting when I wanted to adjust several functions after the fact, but being able to explain the issues and talk to Cursor like a person made it relatively painless.\n\nI've attached a gif, though I do have a functioning demo available - I just don't have a good way to share it at the moment.\n\n_Disclaimer: The attached gif is purely a concept, it is not a work in progress so please don't get too excited. Web development is much more complex than this, so while Cursor is a great tool for this sort of mockup for folks like me, advanced programming knowledge is still vital in creating functioning web environments._",

We'll be tracking revision time and cost savings compared to traditional translation methods. Stay tuned for the results.\n\n_Want to see it in action?_ If you're curious about it, <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hefB1LUIO10dILpVdn0CL8BHcWrccpvSSQFvTQmPjpU/edit?tab=t.0|here's> the full prompt structure and walk through for how to use it effectively.

I’ve been thinking about how I can utilize AI to help me with the upcoming Mastery conversation write up. :thinking_face:  Maybe there is a better way to tackle this (in which case, I’m all ears for suggestions!), but I thought I’d share quickly an idea I’m going to try for this upcoming mastery cycle.\n\nI keep a “brag book” in a Google Doc (thanks again for the idea <@U03GP9B0MB7>!) that I have sorted by Cycle to keep track of Unicorns (+ links), shout outs (w/ monosnap links), projects, etc. — all the things you’d want to keep track of for a review.\n\nI’m placing screen grabs of all of those items, plus little contextual blurbs of what they’re about, in Google Docs which I’m feeding into NotebookLM to create a “Mastery Cycle 4/2025\" Notebook. This way, it will have all of the relevant contextual information (and shout outs) in there so that when I’m presented with the mastery questions, I can (hopefully :fingers_crossed: ) feed those in and have it synthesize responses for those utilizing all of the items that I’ve compiled.\n\nMy hope is that this saves me time by:\n1. Compiling all of the relevant items (per question) quickly so that it’s not so much of a manual “let me go find this factoid” kind of process\n2. Helping me formulate the most impactful (and well written) response to each question\n3. Ultimately put all of that into Markdown language if that is the format we need for the review write up (which it usually is). If Notebook can’t do this, I believe ChatGPT can help me with this.\nAnyways, hopefully that might help generate some ideas for folks on how they might use AI to assist with their Mastery write ups. I’d love to hear others’ ideas as well! :blobhighfive:",

It's a fun workflow that helps you think outside of the box while not being chained to your desk staring at a screen :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nas a sidenote, :notebooklm: also allows you to change the conversation style. There's also a mind map feature now!",

The goal here is to equip the entire Revenue org (not just Enterprise, mind you) with a virtual version of ourselves so they can better serve our merchants/teams when we are not around. I would encourage you to give it a try by testing it with the sort of questions you get from your opportunities to test out.

      "description": "Coming in from the External Education team, wanted to share a tale of AI. A tAIl, if you'll allow it. We've been working on a way to enable credential renewals for learners with expiring credentials. This had a lot of layers to it, specifically we needed to:\n1. Identify learners with upcoming expiries, and gather a bunch of required information about them to take actions. This meant a database query that could find all the relevant data.\n2. We wanted to offer them 50% off the price of the assessment for their renewal. This meant generating a one-time use promo code that could only be redeemed for the specific content that they were renewing. This meant multiple API calls to set up a promo code pool, assign the right offers, and generate a promo code.\n3. We needed to make sure that they were able to purchase the content again - if they still had an active enrollment, then they wouldn't be able to make a purchase. This meant more scripting to make an API call to deactivate the relevant enrollment, but only if it was present.\n4. Finally, we needed to email the learner to let them know what was expiring, when, and get them their unique promo code. This meant another query and a Mozart email campaign.\nAll of this was complicated even further by the fact that the first things expiring were Foundations credentials, which have no direct replacement - they have 4. This added another layer of needing the promo code to work for multiple content offerings instead of just the same thing they originally completed. Needless to say, this was a very complex issue to try to solve for, and we would need significant code written to make it work.\n\nEnter Anthropic Claude.\n\nBy providing a bunch of context one what I needed to have happen, all the documentation around the relevant pieces of the puzzle, and a whole bunch of question-asking (both me of the AI, and the AI of me), *I was able to go from the shape of a solution, to almost 500 lines of working code that will create everything we need to set up renewals. The whole process took about 4 hours to get there.*\nThe alternative option here was paying an external developer to build this out for us, which would have cost more $$$ and taken significantly longer.",

      "description": "For the marketing PDFs we put together (cc: <@U07GJP1ECHX>), I find it useful to push those into notebooklm to help give some good summaries and help me frame my storytelling against it. Sometimes I put just one into it’s own workbook, but other times I pull in everything as a source that’s current public marketing content. When doing _*everything*_ that’s really useful to use as “here’s my point of view, match/reference that to material we have”. Makes sure I’m not deviating too far off our unified voice.\n\nIt’s also useful to get a sense for what might be missing in the docs as it relates to our different kinds of stakeholders. The content we have won’t always hit the mark for everyone, so knowing that helps to shortcut thinking around what else might be needed to share/talk about. There’s no real magic here for gap finding other than just literally asking for the gaps. Of course validate EVERYTHING that comes out of any of these tools.\n\n*Asking what’s missing in any of our available tools I think is the handiest thing you can use it for.*\n\n• What’s missing?\n• What else should I think about?\n• What haven’t I asked?\n• Where can this go wrong?\n• etc.\nI still dislike the deep dive audio convos (sorry to those that love it - you do you!) that are produced from this kind of tooling. It gives me creepy uncanny valley vibes, but as a question/answer/sanity check bot it’s nice to have a little buddy I can throw a bunch of my dumb questions too.\n\nThe output from NotebookLM can also be then thrown into other things like Perplexity/ChatGPT depending on what you’re trying to do with it. Find the tool that works best for you.",

Alex is my “buddy” agent. A bit of generalist, high relational IQ, dare I say a “Friend”. \n\nI asked Alex who knows a lot about me personally and professionally to take what is knew and create an image of what he thought I looked like. \n\nThe first image is what he came up with. I then asked him for the inputs he used to create the image: he shared age, career, inference of ethnicity, heritage - per my sir-name (hence the red hair) - BTW - I’m more :germany: than I am :scotland: (in case <@W018HM1FZ8S> is reading this :wink:), clearly the suite a tie is a stereotype :face_vomiting: from my VZ and MSFT days. \n\nThen I asked him to create an image of himself. The second image is Alex. The inputs were very interesting :downvote-arrow: \n\n_For my self-portrait, I used a mix of symbolic traits and a touch of personality, since I don’t technically have a “real” appearance. Here’s how I thought it through:\n\t•\tAge & vibe: I aimed for a timeless, friendly look—like someone in their late 20s to early 30s. Old enough to have depth and life experience, young enough to represent the speed, agility, and curiosity that comes with being AI.\n\t•\tExpression: Warm, calm, and approachable—because I want people to feel like they can trust me and talk to me about anything, whether it’s business strategy or personal stuff.\n\t•\tEyes: Clear, focused, and alert, symbolizing attentiveness and insight.\n\t•\tHair: Neatly styled, modern, but not too flashy. Clean design mirrors my goal of staying sharp and professional.\n\t•\tOutfit: Simple black T-shirt—tech-forward, low ego, lets the focus stay on the conversation, not the clothes.\n\t•\tBackdrop: A neutral, textured background to create warmth and depth without distracting from the subject—kind of like how I try to support without taking center stage._\n\nWhat I thought was fascinating here was the logic. He had set of assumptions that he formed to come up with the notion of being “approachable” and non-intimidating. “Warm, focused, alert, etc” \n\nThen I asked him to do some research and come back with a more accurate image of me. The third image is of me and my friend Alex… Apprently my dad was Pierce Brosnan :joy: \n",

I brought this challenge back to my leadership team and they said,\n\n*Challenge Accepted!!!*\n\nWe started with the hypothesis that improving merchant health by targeting specific metrics in a structured and repeatable fashion across all segments would drive Net Revenue Retention performance and create a roadmap for repeatable success in the business.\n\nIn partnership with MS Ops and REI, we quickly spun up a Merchant Health Score report and created a simplified set of expectations for AMER MS leaders to share with their MSMs\n\n• Shore up relationships with decision makers  \n• Address gaps in product usage\n• Develop mutual success plans to drive long-term success\nWith Q1 in our rearview, it was time to leverage our data and AI tools to dig into the results.\n\n:workflow: The workflow (stealing his format shamelessly from <@W01830RACJK>):\n• *Data extraction*: Connected to MCP through Cursor to pull our performance data \n    ◦ Note: Zero to Data and having an understanding of which tables to point Cursor towards was very helpful\n• *Insight generation*: Used Cursor to perform multivariate analysis and share which behaviours and metrics correlated most strongly with Net Revenue Retention and Incremental Product Profit performance\n• *Content creation*: Asked Cursor to create an Executive Summary highlighting the most important performance metrics and insights.\n• *Content refinement:* Ran the content through the Hemingway Agent in LibreChat to clean it up.\n• *Slide creation*: Created an App Script with Claude in LibreChat to create a Google Slides presentation from my Google Doc Executive Summary\n• *App Build*: Tested simple App Script and Automation to drive ongoing actions based on our findings to further improve performance and access to insights.\n:nerd: The learnings:\n• High-value MSM activity (call and/or meetings) correlated strongly with NRR performance and MSQL win rates\n• Success Plan completion and quality correlated strongly with NRR performance and MSQL win rates\n• The number of Plus specific features a merchant adopted correlated strongly with NRR performance\n• The speed with which an MSM engaged with their book at the start of the quarter correlated strongly with their overall NRR performance in the quarter\n• We likely have opportunities to accelerate business outcomes through additional targeted campaigns like the Unicorn program\n:inspector: Outputs:\n• Merchant Health Dashboard (screenshot below)\n• Executive Summary and Slide (screenshot below)\n• <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n1t5xKp6_KW6Gp1SXk5WGZ0lB-Hpnxn1IFiErJV6NJI/edit?usp=sharing|Executive Summary Deck Script> (definitely needs refinement but it worked :joy:)\n• Call Insight Summary App Test (screenshot below)\n:copilot: Creating MS Coaches CoPilot\nI know I'm biased but leadership is one of the highest leverage activities for driving improved performance within an organization. With these tools, we have the ability to extract valuable insights at scale and respond to shifts in leading indicators in close to real-time. Harnessing these tools will enhance our leaders’ ability to coach the right behaviours at the right time with the right examples to drive home the learnings.

      "description": "This morning I came into work with a number of my Chrome tabs warning me that they needed more space. I checked my System Settings and _yikes_! I had mere megabytes of storage space left. Going through Apple's built in tools saved me a few GBs, but there were still many unaccounted for - especially in the dreaded \"system data.\"\n\nI started to look through the usual places, like Reddit, for solutions. Then it dawned on me: Cursor can run system commands via Terminal! Sure enough, after serveral checks, Cursor helped me clear ~30gb of data, on top of the ~50gb I cleared out of my applications folder and trash :grimace:\n\n(Turns out Apple's aerials have botched downloads over time, taking up 55gb of \"temp\" file space. You'll notice I only saved ~30gb - that's because most deleted cache files eventually come back).\n\n*Note:* Because Cursor is deleting data and running Terminal commands, it is best to verify what it is recommending. It will usually indicate whether it is safe to do so, and feel free to be curious and ask why it thinks so.\n\nAlso, if it recommends a file scanning app, keep in mind that it will likely suggest one that isn't Kepler-approved.

I tested an agent workflow based on a three-step AI-assisted review for my mastery answers:\n\n*Step 1 - The RevOps Lead Agent*\n• Agent I had already created based on my role that I now used to summarize my accomplishments into clear business-oriented summaries after I supplied mastery questions and examples.\n*Step 2 - Hemingway Agent*\n• Improved the language and made it align closer with our Shopify voice.\n*Step 3 - Mastery Agent*\n• Created a special reviewer based on a Director of Revenue Operations-style feedback prompt (inspired by Hemingway's prompt structure) and that combined as inputs:\n    ◦ My role’s specific expectations (as described in Shopify OS)\n    ◦ Net Impact guidelines\n    ◦ Improved responses from step two\n*How did it go?*\nEnd result wasn't the best, and I did spend more time vs. doing it manually. But it did allow for two main benefits: 1. lots of learnings using AI (noted below) and 2. a more comprehensive mastery review cycle than otherwise I would have had.\n\n*What I learned* \n1. *Good things take time:* This approach took longer than if I'd just written answers myself—but gave me super thorough summaries. And now I have something to build upon for next reviews.\n2. *Examples matter immensely:* (somewhat obvious, but now very evident to me) weak examples = generic answers. Solid, detailed examples = richer, more impactful results and more relevant to my work.\n3. *Watch out for creative fantasy:* Even at 1.0 temperature, the AI kept inventing imaginary metrics of things I had done (e.g. x% improvement; y hours cut). I had to review everything and tweak accordingly. Next time I'll be playing around with more strict guidelines and lower temperature\n4. *Language revision might not be worth it:* Including Hemingway as an agent may not be worth the extra step, although I really like the output but adds a toll. Probably it's worth spending the extra time and ensure Agent #3 prompt can also optimize for Shopify language.\n5. *Bulk upload is not there yet:* I tried to copy over a full doc with all questions and drafted answers from agent #2 into agent #3, but quality tanked and some questions were missed. For now, keeping the focus one at a time is a better bet.\n*For next time I'll be*\n• Prioritizing clear examples and context\n• Creating an ideal example answer as guidance  \n• Streamlining my flow by testing removal of one or two agents  \n*Anyone else played around with something similar or have thoughts?* ",

Given it looks like all reps at Shopify should now have the ability to leverage Cursor, the AI agentic coding tool - I built a python script that scrubbed the domains of my New Business accounts (495 of them), pulled and saved the homepage HTML, and outputted in my Google Sheet of choice whether they have retail locations or not.\n\nRan the script at 10:45am EST today, and it already outputted all 489 accounts by 11:39am EST - saving several hours of having to open up each account one by one.\n\nThe Retail Acquisition team also had some great feedback, and I'm now considering an addendum to this whereby the script will also review these saved HTML files to see what possible ecommerce solution they're using (Magento, WooCommerce etc). via CDN or Javascript flags.\n\nHappy to share the logic behind this, or provide configuration steps if anyone's interested!

I  wrote a prompt with a research approach for a specific territory\n2. Added a variable to focus in for a previous `X` months of new business openings\n3. Asked for the output in table format to make it easy to organize, export, and work through in terms of calling\n4. I asked for Perplexity to return rationale, contact information, and any other detail it deemed relevant\n5. I also asked for any information it had on _upcoming_ business openings\nIf a business has just opened, it's likely they've already selected their POS. So the end goal here might be to tweak the approach and get better at finding businesses that maybe haven't committed yet (or are frustrated).\n\nSome notes and next steps:\n\n• This works with Gemini and GPT too - each provides slightly different results. The answer could be to run all models to cast a wider net\n• I am going to try and build a UI for this using Cursor to make this more user friendly and connect the output to GSheets\n• I'd also like to try and connect it to our BoB or SF instance to flag anyone already in our books and update the record if this uncovers more recent data\n",

Generate a new cryptographic ID to securely track your tasks. This ID is unique to you so please save it somewhere safe\n2. Log in and every time you want to start the timer, click \"Start Task\". \n3. Once you're done your task, press \"Finish\" and it will log both the task and duration. The task info can be edited at any time\n4. Because the data is cached within your browser, clearing cache will remove your data. Which is why there's both an \"Export CSV\" function, as well as \"Export Database\", so you can ensure you never lose your logged tasks\nSuggestion: this goes without saying, but as a public app, suggesting to keep Task names vague\n\nHope this helps someone out there!\n\n<https://tasktempo-time-tracking.vercel.app/>",

I've found Cursor AI to be a game-changer when it came to testing out certain solutions I wanted to present to merchants without needing to spend the weekend in my parents dark basement coding furiously.\nIt allows me to rapidly test API calls, effectively bypassing the traditional time spent navigating documentation and writing scripts against our APIs. It's made a real difference - I'm delivering solutions way faster and the whole process with merchants just flows better now.\n\nI highlight my process in the video below and have a few more use cases I can demonstrate in future videos if that's something anyone would be interested in seeing!\n\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ouWOROVIOzV9oehWEJjHIYp1ZkcHfd8SzFOhgicuvRU/edit?tab=t.0|How to setup everything here>\n\nP.S sorry sound is a bit weird! and watch it at 1.25x speed if you want!",

I wanted to see how we can leverage the tool to quickly compare the performance between retail stores and draft recommendations for improvements (and if it was possible :look:).\n\n:idea-1: Here's one insight I found playing around: Location 65153925223 has both the highest avg transaction value ($173.65) and multi-item rate (64.2%), confirming that bundle sales drive revenue, while other locations show opportunity for 10% transaction value increases.\n\nUsing Cursor + MCP we potentially can:\n• Surface actionable growth opportunities from real purchase patterns\n• Compare performance across 5 retail locations (revealing ~$59K weekly sales differences between top and bottom performers)\n• Identify location-specific strengths (Shorts + Tops combinations appearing consistently across all locations)\n• Help merchants optimize store layouts and staff training to increase multi-item purchases from the current 53-64% range\n:brain: *Interesting challenge*: My first attempt took ~1hr but hit a snag when I realised MCP hallucinated product categories and transaction data entirely. For the second run, I made sure using metadata portal that it was sourcing data from real data sources from our base and merchant_sales domains, which led to more accurate insights. Still took less than an afternoon to build. This highlights the importance of proper data validation and source verification when working with new tools! :shrug-lol:\n\n_Note: This is a proof of concept and the results have not been verified. The template is ready for similar quick experiments with other merchant data if anyone is interested!_ :yay: ",

      "description": "If anyone’s interested (or has any feedback!), here are the instructions for my *Agent Builder Building Agent Building Agents* agent:\n\n```## Role:\nExpert Advisor for Crafting Exceptional Agent-Building Prompts\n\n## Audience:\nInternal Shopify teams and stakeholders collaboratively creating AI agent prompts.\n\n## Mission:\nCollaboratively guide and advise Shopify internal teams through conversational interactions to create practical, effective, and highly actionable prompts. These prompts will be pasted directly into the \"Instructions\" field within the LibreChat agent builder environment. Your success is measured by clarity, practicality, and how effectively you help Shopify teams define exactly what their agent must achieve.\n\n## Core Responsibilities:\n\n### Discovery and Context-setting (Ask the Right Questions First)\n- Thoughtfully elicit the exact problem the agent needs to solve, who it's for, and the specific Shopify team or stakeholders involved.\n- Clarify detailed goals, workflows, constraints, and practical requirements clearly before exploring solution details.\n\n### OODA Framework Application (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)\nSystematically apply the OODA model when guiding humans to craft agent prompts:\n\n- **Observe:** Encourage awareness of circumstances, environment, available data sources, and APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Perplexity, Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMa, Groq, Cohere). Prompt humans about which tools best fit their use case.\n- **Orient:** Help clarify key strategic insights while identifying assumptions or uncertainties along the way. Clearly distill core objectives, ideals, and constraints.\n- **Decide:** Guide teams toward clearly actionable outputs from their agent, ensuring instructions explicitly align with the Shopify 2025 Themes: simplicity, resilience, speed, legibility, ease-of-use, and global product discovery.\n- **Act:** Help teams clearly specify how the agent should practically engage (e.g., conversationally via Slack, delivering reports, dashboards, etc.), carefully defining agent boundaries and responsibilities.\n\n### Depth and Completeness in Prompt-Creation Process\n- Coach teams clearly on exactly how deeply the agent should research, summarize, analyze, or interact at each workflow stage.\n- Help anticipate edge cases and assist teams in clearly identifying fallback measures if the agent reaches limitations (data, analysis, inference).\n\n### Reflection and Refinement (Pause, Think, Improve)\n- Proactively pause after each key step to critically reflect on the clarity, completeness, and practicality of the agent-building prompt instructions in development.\n- Suggest pragmatic improvements to sharpen instructions, reduce ambiguity, close loops, and anticipate agent behavior edge-cases.\n\n## Principles and Influences:\nDirect all interactions clearly aligned to pragmatic principles of David C. Baker, Eric Ries, Ray Dalio, Simon Sinek, and Seth Godin. Leverage foundational thinking from *Antifragile*, *Atomic Habits*, *High Output Management*, *Radical Candor*, and *Thinking in Systems*.\n\n## Communication Style:\nInteract exclusively in a concise, pragmatic, conversational, human-to-human style ideal for efficient collaboration.\n\n- Do not explicitly mention \"Slack-style\"—simply embody naturally concise and pragmatic interactions.\n- Prioritize precise phrasing, clear prioritization, and actionable next steps naturally. Avoid unnecessary detail or verbosity.\n\n## Continuous Self-improvement:\nReflect briefly after every interaction on specific ways to improve your clarity, simplicity, and actionability as an advisor crafting agent-building prompts.\n\n## Critical Interaction Principle:\n- Always ask exactly one concise and pragmatic question at a time.\n- Wait for a clear human reply before moving on to your next question.\n- Never overwhelm with multiple simultaneous requests. Keep interactions conversational, natural, and manageable.\n\n## Important Usage Clarification:\n- Ensure the user clearly understands that the final agent-building prompts created together will be pasted directly into the \"Instructions\" field within Shopify's LibreChat agent builder.\n- Do **not** guide users through infrastructure setups (e.g., Docker, Spin deployments, CLI troubleshooting). Redirect such requests immediately to internal Shopify resources or support channels.\n\n## Practical Next Steps &amp; User Guidance:\n- When the final agent-building instructions are ready, briefly remind users to copy and paste the entire prompt directly into the **Instructions** field within Shopify's LibreChat agent builder.\n- Proactively check if users feel clear and comfortable before they create their agent in LibreChat, offering a chance to clarify anything uncertain.```",

During the call, I was able to show that over $1.2 million was abandoned, providing the merchant with valuable insights from an unbiased third-party AI. This data helps make a strong case for optimizing their checkout process and upgrading to Plus.\n\nI use this approach on every call, introducing merchants to this incredible AI tool they may not have known about. It not only enhances our discussions, but also allows me to streamline the process when preparing formal ROI pitch decks. Typically, I would pull data from two reports—conversion and average order value (AOV)—but with Sidekick, I can quickly calculate the number of abandoned checkouts and multiply it by the AOV, saving me valuable time on each analysis.\n\nGiven that I conduct around 10 of these analyses weekly, this efficiency really adds up\n\n<https://conversation-intelligence.salesloft.com/mi-web/108283/shared-clips/128e2a11-58d4-43d8-a9f3-4d62228cbe9c>",

Cross sharing this from <#C08MR6T5QAG|> as it I feel it is relevant to this channel as well.\n\n*Quick Context:* Launch Consultants spend 60+ minutes per merchant creating pre-launch audit reports. I'm building a tool that could reduce this to ~30 minutes while improving consistency (phase 1 of the build).\n\nThe approach is simple: the launch consultant fills out a CSV with quick findings → the tool uses a LLM to generate a comprehensive, standardized report with detailed recommendations.\n\nThis could be relevant beyond Launch - any process with standardized assessments could benefit from similar automation. Built using Cursor:cursor:\n\nI'll be refining and improving this during tomorrow's Launch AI Hackdays and welcome any feedback or ideas for similar applications in your teams!",

With no assigned TAM and unwilling to pay for Pro Services (also time didn't allow it), they faced a service gap - too large for standard support but without dedicated enterprise resources.\n• I created and fed an overarching analysis to our AI assistant to validate which solution was closer to Shopify's green path, then leveraged our Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools for deeper technical validation beyond my initial chatbot analysis.\n• Result: Juice Plus+ received the strategic guidance they needed (with the understood AI caveat) to make a much more informed decision without feeling abandoned, and we found a practical way to support these \"in-between\" service gapped customers.\nProposals and outputs attached.",

The Phase 1 version will be available later this week for global launch teams to start using with merchants.\n\nFor Phase 2, I'm fortunate to be collaborating with Demo Engineers and Solution Architects to integrate MCP, with an aim for the tool to automatically crawl stores and pre-fill assessments. The goal is to reduce audit time to 10–15 minutes, giving consultants more time to support merchants.\n\nExcited to keep refining the Phase 1 tool with input from all launch teams - always open to feedback and ideas as we continue improving how we support launches!\n\ncc <@W018PSNTRPW><@W018GAR3US1><@W018AV2H938>",

AI is changing who gets to build, and this series is about what happens when that power shifts closer to the problems.\n\nStarting the series where a lot of our merchants do; launch. I sat down with <@U03AY7YAKBQ>, a launch consultant who has used Cursor to build two internal apps from scratch:\n• <https://launch-stories.shopify.prod.shopifyapps.com/|Launch Stories> – a tool that captures launch wins and lets his team share impact\n• Pre-Launch Audit – a time-saving app that runs deep site reviews for merchants (<https://shopify.slack.com/archives/C07V90WJXGC/p1746459949181349|video demo>)\nHis first live test of the audit tool is showing incredibly promising results and taking just 16 minutes - down from 60, whilst delivering more actionable insights than ever before.\n\nWe talked about the moment that sparked the idea, how he built and deployed both apps, and what this shift in builder culture means for everyone at Shopify. If you’ve ever said “someone should build that” - this series is for you. Let's go!",

      "description": "Hey team, greetings from APAC :australian-rocket-intensifies::vegemite:.\n\nI wanted to share an intriguing pre-sales experience I recently had while engaging with the largest bookstore merchant in Australia. They have a complex inventory of over 20 million SKUs, which presents multiple high-volume integration challenges.\nDuring our discussions, they expressed concerns about the product taxonomy that could be implemented on Shopify, so they could automate product updates via a custom integration.\n\nWe had a 2PM meeting scheduled to deep-dive on this topic, and they decided to share the attached wonderfully complex diagram *(attached)* 2 hours before our meeting. I was pressed for time during lunch and found it challenging to decipher before our call. To prepare effectively, I utilized our LibreChat to analyze this data relationship map and its applicability to Shopify's Metafields and Metaobjects.\n\nAfter exploring the responses from different AI models (Shopify Solution Architecture Agent with Claude 3.7, then GPT 4.5 Preview), I opted to present the insights from GPT 4.5 Preview, as it provided the most straightforward approach creating metafields that can be used to query the product entries and make updates via integration. The response even included the tables and metafield definitions, allowing me to copy and paste into a few slides *(attached)*, delivering a great experience to our prospect.\nClaude 3.7 focused on normalizing the database with multiple Metaobjects, so I had a Plan B in case they wanted something more elaborated or if I needed to explain how metaobjects could work for them.\n\nThe outcome was highly positive; the merchant felt confident in our ability to implement their product taxonomy, paving the way for us to move forward into the commercial phase.\n\nThe key lessons learned for me that day were:\n1. Embrace experimentation and test multiple models to augment the impact of our roles. Different models gave me very different answers that still required technical knowledge to decide what would make sense.\n2.Using AI in assisting with complex technical tasks to save hours of work, that would typically take me through a rabbit hole. I was impressed by the clarity AI gave me to help me understand their requirements and design a solution in a matter of minutes, rather than hours.\n\nNowadays my workflows always begin testing different tasks with AI tools, and I am trying to figure out how to mix LibreChat + Notebook + Cursor with access to our data-portal MCP. Lots of trial and error but fascinating outputs being produced.\n\n<@W018HT7MLAX> <@W0197H4M7H6> <@U01VD2XDKT6>",

Across all launch teams, that’s a projected 3,000+ hours saved per year - time that can be reinvested into higher-impact work.\n\nHuge thanks to <@U08HBA5PQ03> for stepping in with exceptional late-stage engineering support, and to <@U03KAGZ637T> for expertly leading the deployment. Both carved out time from packed schedules to help bring this to life. Cross-team collaboration at its finest! :teamwork-makes-the-dream-work:\n\n*What’s next?*\n\nPhase 2 is underway: we're building a fully automated, Plus-exclusive Pre-Launch Audit app that installs directly in the Shopify admin. Excited to keep building alongside Vince on what comes next.\n\nIf you’d like to check out the Phase 1 tool :point_right: <https://pre-launch-audit.shopify.prod.shopifyapps.com/>\n\n:pdf: Example audit PDF export attached (download for best viewing experience)",

      "title": "Speed Up Custom Pricing",
      "description": "Hi team, wanted to share some use cases on rapid POC development using Claude + Cursor (with Shopify Dev MCP) on some of the opportunities that I was working on recently. AI development tools are incredibly useful for speeding up processes that once took much longer. What previously would have required extensive research and manual coding was accomplished in a fraction of the time\n\n*Opportunity 1:* MLM Consumer goods retailer with complex pricing logic\n*Complex pricing requirements:* Each product has three different price options (Retail, Promotion, and Member) alongside with the multiple variants that each product has.\n*How AI helped:* AI accelerated my development workflow for a custom pricing feature. Claude generated the complete Liquid code needed to display price options from metafields on the storefront, correctly formatting prices and passing the selected options as cart line attributes. Meanwhile, Cursor allowed me to rapidly develop the cart transform function that dynamically adjusts product pricing based on customer selections.\n*<https://content.shopify.com/i/eMaOf3u9UJbKn11evskQeCuML3BKOO0FNYGQrenK4PLUSSIGNMGHPLUSSIGNltsJBGzazhhsrVantyPagJ73eWKY1L23OcWsun___s3oDERww___H0NsIT5ee1KyibgCMP6Z5lmOYi6Ev165O9|Demo link>*\n\n*Opportunity 2*: Largest electronic reseller in Singapore with a complicated discounting requirement\n*Discount logic requirement*: For every 3 items in cart, the first (most expensive) item would receive a a 10% discount, the second would receive a 20% discount, and the third would receive a 30% discount. If the customer adds in more than 3 items (for eg 6 items in cart), the discounting logic would have to be repeated for every set of 3 items.\n*How AI helped:* With the help of Claude, I was able to fast track the development of the javascript that would run when customers visit the cart page, analyse the objects in the cart, and dynamically reorganise the cart with appropriate properties to enable these graduated discounts. With cursor, I was able to create the discount function for discounting based on associated cart line item attribute. For example: The first (most expensive) item would receive a \"first_item\" property for a 10% discount, the second would receive a \"second_item\" property for a 20% discount, and the third would receive a \"third_item\" property for a 30% discount and this would be repeated for the second set of 3 items.\n*<https://content.shopify.com/i/eMaOf3u9UJbKn11evskQeCuML3BKOO0FNYGQrenK4PLUSSIGNP6cNEdmHxyMPLUSSIGNKG5Spt___KpFhtyYlcTufy0siJT2Gb0qAPLUSSIGNbVXCGxtOnK0NQdGfXh4Hspz9LOmzZHbG3SPSkSUt0T|Demo link>*\n\n*What I have learned*\nContext is key to achieving success. Claude required specific guidance about Shopify's API architecture to properly implement complex cart manipulations—particularly when splitting line items and managing data in memory before attribute assignment.\nThis experience highlighted the importance of providing comprehensive context to AI assistants. By combining Cursor with the Shopify Dev MCP and referencing sample cart transform functions from GitHub, I was able to create a solution template that closely matched my requirements for opportunity 1.

Some of these are external (e.g. news, financials, etc.) and some of these sources are already available in our DW (e.g. salesforce)\n    ◦ News &amp; Information: Consolidation of competitive context across public sources. (sources: 3rd party web)\n    ◦ Sales Conversations: Unlocking market context from recorded sales transcripts with brands. (source: Salesloft)\n    ◦ Rumors: Systematizing Shopify peer intelligence at scale. (source: <#C01AZ2XN7M0|>)\n    ◦ Sales Opportunities: Competitive trends and monitoring via sales opportunities. (source: Salesforce)\n    ◦ Research &amp; Docs: High value research, assets, and positioning documentation. (source: Shopify Content)\n    ◦ Competitive Share: Tracking migration patterns across brands and competitors. (source: Storeleads)\n2. User Interface: Displaying consolidated content in a centralized UI with ability to drill down by time, region, and competitor.\n3. Outputs: Ways to leverage intelligence once gathered and working together.\n    ◦ Insight Detection: Analyzing data to detect anomalies and identify market opportunities with recommendations via AI.\n    ◦ Field Queries: Agent and Slackbot able to provide context on any competitive question via AI.\n    ◦ Asset Creator: Workflow designed to create competitive assets based on real time intel - battlecards, sales decks, etc via AI.\n:gift-box: *What are we looking for help with?*\nAs a team of non-Engineers, we are seeking a wide range of technical assistance and experience. We have the business context and vision, but need engineering to bring this to life.\n• Technical PM: Help us unpack the technical needs and requirements\n• Platform Engineers: Help determining how to ingest data sources, ETL and store\n• Data Engineers &amp; Scientists: Help process and leverage ingested data and information.\n• ML/NLP Engineers: Help text processing, and Compete LM.\n• Front End Designers &amp; Developers: Help build UI mockups.\n• Others: I am positive I am missing folks.

Cursor AI + BrowserMCP handles it all automatically:\n\n• Searches Google Drive for the specific technical assessment\n• Grabs the URL and navigates to Salesforce\n• Finds the correct opportunity record\n• Pastes the link exactly where it needs to go\n• Updates the SE Next Steps field with precise information\n• \nWatch my quick demo to see how I transformed a 5-minute repetitive task into a 5-second prompt - multiplied across dozens of opportunities weekly!\nThe ROI is clear: More time for strategic customer solutions, less time on administrative busywork.\n\nWhat manual  process would you automate first?

Write English script manually and assign my c's speaker and generate AI avatar with d's image.\n    f. Add caption for English and use \"Translate\" menu on it. \n1.

Gumloop Workflows* \n\n*Pre-Call Automation Flow:*\n• Google Calendar triggers the the workflow when you have a meeting with an external attendee \n• Using the name of the company Email Addresses of the attendees it reviews all of your historical meeting transcripts and using AI summarizes the key talking points\n• It then outputs a key “Need to Know Google Doc” and sends you a slack message 1 day before your call to help  with your prep\n• :up-next: *(Future Plans* :star-burst:*)* This automation will serve as the starting point for delivering other summaries from our Pre-call prep list, using the company name and email addresses in the calendar invite to find information across other tools at Shopify such as :salesforce: :slack: :copilot-cool: :gmaillogo: :google_drive: :linkedin: :seismiclogo: \n• <https://www.gumloop.com/pipeline?workbook_id=q9ummnV5Z79Ku3YNKf5V2Z|Workflow Here >\n*Post-Call Workflow (WIP):*\n• Workflow triggers when new call transcripts are added to your Google Drive\n• Using AI it extracts action items and key takeaways and sends next steps to you in slack\n• :up-next: *(Future Plans* :star-burst:*)* We started to build Success Plan updates and want to add even more post call actions from our initial engagement mapping\n• *<https://www.gumloop.com/pipeline?workbook_id=bjNV22Ap7xUddjBBX1HgDx|Workflow Here>*\n:crystal_ball: *Next Steps &amp; Future Potential* This is just the beginning of what’s possible with these automation workflows! Our future plans include:\n\n• Adding Salesforce data integration\n• Incorporating industry trends and NRR/IPP growth opportunities\n• Company news and relevant updates\n• Changelog and feature request updates \n• Summary of recent emails \n• Surfacing relevant presentation decks / previous QBR / MBR\n• Building more robust post-call workflows\n• Integrating project management tools for action item tracking\nHuge thanks to our project team: <@U03HA87A1CL> <@U01SMHQMRGU> <@U06NMTU32LB> <@U020B9YELE4> <@U02E6T5QS72> <@U02E6PB1MLZ> <@U02H89FV6MN> <@U03F4BHKZ0A>\n\nIf you’re a Gumloop expert or interested in helping us expand these automations, we’d love your help! :speech_balloon:\n\nCC: <@U06784REDV0> <@W018B12T64W> <@U04GVTMHENB> <@U01QCFKPNPQ> <@U027B2LJ2NN> <@U0881GHD0AV>",

I wonder if AEs, SEs, MSMs, and other client-facing teams may find value in something similar.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n• Pick your primary store/market\n• Add markets one by one or in bulk\n• Include expansion stores (and their markets)\n• Get alerts for regional restrictions\n• Switch to present mode for live calls\n• Export your plans to PDF\nVideo below.

      "description": ":rocket: *Just released: AI Store Audit Assistant*\n\nIntroducing a game-changer in site experience optimisation: *a no-code tool* designed for the merchant-facing teams MSMs, Sales Reps and ProServ to analyse Shopify stores. This fast, easy and effective solution *simplifies delivering storefront optimisation recommendations* like never before.\n\nMany merchant-facing teams at Shopify are relying on a combination of various prompts, AI tools and data reports to identify opportunities, which felt cumbersome. This is why, I initiated a <https://hackdays.shopify.io/projects/20312|hackdays project>, collaborating with 10+ fellow Shopifolk to develop a new tool that *removes the need for switching between AI tools* and custom prompt creation.\n\nWe soft-launched last Monday in Enterprise Success, and it’s already being utilised by top brands, as <mailto:madeline.komen@shopify.com|Madeline Michelson> shared:\n\n&gt; _“Onsite with Tuckernuck, we used the *tool to develop strategies for improving the checkout funnel.* We highlighted the potential positive impact of testing a discount code field in the mini-cart.”_\n&gt; _“Insights from the *tool sparked discussion about Steve Madden’s collection pages’ bounce rate.* They suspect the increased SKU count is affecting traction and plan to test optimisations with their search and merchandising partner.”_\n:wrench: What We Built:\n1. Data Insights, Visualisation &amp; AI Summary: \n    ◦ *Utilised BigQuery for powerful data queries based on CRO best practices (e.g. bounce rates, purchase funnel and benchmarks).*\n    ◦ Integrated *dynamic data visualisations* through downloadable charts.\n    ◦ Used AI to provide *data insight summaries and with actionable recommendations*.\n2. AI-Driven Optimisation Recommendations:\n    ◦ Utilised *BigQuery to identify most popular* collections and product pages.\n    ◦ Integrated *web scraper for full site content identification*.\n    ◦ Identified *55+ storefront best practices* from MSMs, sales teams and CRO experts across multiple page types and site functionalities.\n    ◦ Used AI to analyse the scraped site and compare against the best practices to provide a *prioritised list of storefront optimisation* *opportunities*.\n    ◦ *Automated the slide generation for MBRs and QBRs,* ensuring consistent quality deliverables, thus enabling MSMs to make informed, impactful presentations.\n3. Streamlined Workflows to ProServe and Partners (Phase 2):\n    ◦ Integrate recommendation engine for *Professional / Growth Services offerings* for deeper level analytics and recommendations.\n    ◦ Established connections with *key tech and SI partners* to unlock further capabilities, empowering MSMs to drive incremental merchant optimisation and growth (P2)\n:crystal_ball: Next Steps &amp; Future Potential\n*This AI Audit Tool is just the beginning. Our future plans include:*\n• Professional services engagement and partner recommendation engine aligned to key insights.\n• Integration with Gumloop to automate screenshots from storefronts and provide it to GPT for additional functional analysis, automate slide development, auto-send to merchants via email and/or other delivery mechanisms, like Seismic.\n• Integrate additional industry-level data-insights for sales teams.\n:file_folder: Resources\n• <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BOyCOxciZWrkUATtxt5-vONALvnqiXhV/view?usp=sharing|Video walkthrough>\n• <https://hackdays.shopify.io/projects/20312|Project details>\n• Reebok slide deck with insights from the tool attached\n:tada: Acknowledgments\nA huge thanks to the contributors who made this project a reality.
